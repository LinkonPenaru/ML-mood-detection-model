 Collected a dataset of approximately 278,000 songs from Kaggle. The dataset was first processed using the K-means clustering technique to group songs based on relevant features. The clustered data was then integrated into a face detection model, which analyzed facial attributes to infer user preferences. Based on these inputs, the system generated five personalized song recommendations.
